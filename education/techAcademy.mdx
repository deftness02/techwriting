**Graduated:** Projected December 2023

## Description

Since 2020, I've been an active contributor to a number of open source projects using
languages such as C#. I've also been working on my own projects, which I've been using
to learn new technologies and improve my skills.

While I've been using HTML, CSS, and SQL for over a decade, much of what I know in other
languages has been self-taught. I've been able to read most coding languages and craft some
code examples for documentation projects, but I saw attending The Tech Academy as an opportunity
to expand my skills further into the realm of computer science. While it isn't ultimately my goal
to transition from technical writing to software engineering, I view the learning achieved with
this program as an opportunity to expand my relevance and value as a technical writer. Imagine:
a technical writer that can not only write about a product, but also write the product itself! Or
maybe just write code examples without draining from the already-limited time of developers.

I'm currently enrolled in The Tech Academy's C# & .NET Framework Software Developer Bootcamp
to learn more about C# and .NET, as well as to learn more about software development in general.
This program covers not only the foundations of using HTML and CSS, but also delves into the world
of software development with JavaScript, SQL, C#, and .NET, as well as other best practices such as
agile development (which I've already been an active participant of for 10+ years), version control
like GitHub (which I've also been using for years), and more.

I'll post some of my completed projects here once I've produced something noteworthy. Until then,
