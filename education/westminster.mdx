## Information

**Degree:** Master of Professional Communication<br />
**Graduated:** June 2013

## Description

During my time at ParentLink/Blackboard, I felt a strong desire to further myself both
professionally and personally. My manager provided me with numerous opportunities to expand
my own abilities and acted as a mentor. He instilled in me the desire to expand my horizons
and abilities, which is what ultimately led to my decision to go through graduate school.

In early 2010, I applied to the Master of Professional Communication (MPC) program. This
graduate studies program offered courses that not only encouraged higher-level thinking,
but also gave assignments with real-world applications. The MPC curriculum emphasized various
aspects of communication in the professional world, embracing new industry trends in all areas
relating to business, from public relations to marketing copywriting to technical writing.
