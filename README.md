# My Technical Writing Portfolio
Hello there and welcome to my technical writing portfolio! If you're unfamiliar with GitHub, you'll immediately notice that this "site" doesn't quite look or navigate like a regular website. 
This is a "repository," or storage point, that I'm currently using for my portfolio as I'm between web hosting providers at the moment. However, this repo navigates like your standard explorer
application, and you can view both descriptions of my work history as well as examples of documentation I've written at various employers. Simply click on the desired directory and it'll take
you to both Markdown files and examples (typically PDFs) of the content I've written over the years.

However, to help you navigate my portfolio repository, I've included some details below with links to specific portfolio pieces. For additional information about myself, please feel free to 
visit the [About Me](https://github.com/deftness02/techwriting/blob/main/intro.mdx) page.
