# About Me

Since my early childhood, I’ve found my passion in the technology industry. In high school,
I taught myself how to construct computers, develop websites, and design simple video games.
However, due to my proclivity as a writer, I chose to pursue a career in technical writing upon
graduating from college. Over the last 14 years, I have since fulfilled numerous positions in
diverse industries and I have likewise written hundreds of pages of user content.

I don’t expect my cover letter and resume alone to demonstrate the type of work I perform or who
I am as a person. I have an extensive range of portfolio items. You’ll find technical documentation,
video tutorials, marketing documents, and full help libraries spanning a variety of software products
and industries where I’ve worked over the years.

## Content Strategy
Any documentation library is only as good as its content strategy, meaning all of its aspects
must work together with a single objective in mind. Whenever I approach a documentation task,
I consider existing resources and seek out opportunities both coordinate and augment resources.
This typically means having a thorough understanding of the end user in addition to the use cases
that apply to the topic being documented.

## User Experience Writing
Understanding the end user is critical before any documentation can be written to an effective
degree. One cannot document a new feature without knowing what needs are being addressed by a
new functionality and who exactly will benefit from its use. In past jobs I’ve been part of
developing user personas, which are used to target documentation to differing users. In addition,
I’ve worked with UX departments to coordinate documentation efforts, identify opportunities to
standardize or improve the user interface and its field names, and improve product navigability
overall. Rather than merely focus on the objective of writing documentation, I help UX come up
with microcopy, wireframes, and other interface changes to help make the user experience more
intuitive and positive.

## Network Management
My experience not only includes managing device security settings, but also researching and
documenting complex network configurations and settings, ranging from DNS/DNSmask analysis,
DHCP server and IP assignment, establishing QOS prioritization/lanes, in-depth firewall rules,
and writing scripts for automating the configuration and setup of new hardware assets. I’ve also
gained significant experience managing network access points, switches, and gateways, and data
flow using on factors like requesting/receiving application, device metadata, and other data
prioritization methods.

## Data Security
During my time at companies like ivanti and Dremio as well as during my free time, I’ve taken
on the role of pseudo-SME regarding data/device security from a documentation standpoint. I’ve
documented all aspects of zero trust security and attack surface reduction for intranets,
cloud-based, and hybrid companies on topics like OAuth 2.0, JWT, Okta, SCIM, and personal token
support.

## Security Infrastructure
Understanding how clients secure their hardware assets is a far-reaching and complex subject.
As such, I’ve found numerous opportunities to write about and learn to use myriad tools and
utilities available to secure authentication via OAuth 2.0, JWTs, Okta, SCIM, and personal tokens.
I’ve also delved into great depth regarding integrated systems like Azure Active Directory, LDAP,
and AWS (IAM) in addition to information security subjects like zero trust environments and attack
surface reduction strategies. My experience at Dremio thus spans topics like access control,
privilege management, object chaining/ownership, data masking, and access policies. During my time
at ivanti, I wrote short-format text and exhaustive user guides/libraries regarding key IT
management tasks like creating, pushing, and analyzing mobile devices with payloads spanning
network restrictions, secure communication protocols, and software.Understanding how clients

## Programming Expertise
Since my early years in high school, I’ve been reading and writing code for a variety of purposes.
Originally, it was HTML/CSS websites. Then it progressed to reading various languages. Now I find
myself coding for API specs, using C# to develop web-based servers, creating bash/shell scripts,
learning Python, and navigating database queries.
