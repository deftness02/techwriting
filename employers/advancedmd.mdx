_Technical Writer_

## Job Duties

* Presented with the Inspiring Innovation Award by the company CEO during a quarterly
all-hands meeting for exemplary work performed with documenting the product’s integration
of ICD codes, the medical billing industry’s newest numerical diagnostic coding list (as
of 2011).
* Acted as scrum master for 2 engineering teams for 1 year. Beyond simply leading each
standup, I created daily scrum reports for management, identified and addressed roadblocks
for team members, and coordinated efforts between team members to swarm or reassign tasks
and stories in the pursuit of mint sprints (100% done). One team I served as scrum master for
achieved a mint sprint 2 months in a row.
* Became a company-certified trainer for AdvancedMD Practice Management. After completing the
40-hour introductory training all new employees were required to participate in, I studied for
and passed all 7 internal exams with 95% or higher scores in fewer than 4 months of employment
(even with years of experience, the average employee took 6 months). Using my newfound superpowers
as a trainer, I assisted in several customer training classes.
* Created technical, training, and help documentation supporting software projects for company
providing healthcare management and electronic health record (EHR) solutions to medical practices.
* Managed documentation needs for 2 development teams, totaling 10 developers and 2 testers.
* Wrote and edited help files, feature and screen specifications, and release guide notes.
* Started department efforts at migrating internal documentation specification library to new
storage location.
* Edited the formatting of help files and feature specifications through WYSIWYG editors like
Madcap Flare and Microsoft FrontPage.
* Peer reviewed department documentation for accuracy and consistency in style and tone.
* Interviewed subject matter experts (SMEs) for details regarding product UI changes, feature
enhancements, and bug fixes.

via Scrum tracking software daily.
